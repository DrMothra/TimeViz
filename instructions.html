                <h3>Viewing</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the TimeViz application. This app gives a demonstration of a more general visualisation tool being developed to visualise multi-dimensional
                    or time-varying data. In this example we have used information relating to the highest grossing horror films of all time and cross-referenced this with their
                    individual ratings as given by film review websites. This illustrates how attributes of the data can be viewed over a period of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the page first loads you'll see a number of data items. You can use the mouse buttons to move around the scene and get a different view of the data
                    - the left mouse rotates, the middle mouse button
                    pans around and the mouse wheel enables zooming in and out of the scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To gain an insight as to how the data varies over time, adjust the view such that you are can see the transparent area that the data is contained within
                    (you may have to zoom out a little). An illustration is given below.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/instruct1.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>
                    This represents
                    both the year that the data is applicable to and the time range under consideration. If you now look at the GUI at the top right then you'll see a label marked
                    Data. if you click on this then you'll see a couple of sliders that enable you to select the individual year and an appropriate time range. The number of films within
                    the selected region is displayed in the information panel on the left-hand side (along with all the year data). If you now slide the year slider around you'll see how
                    much money the films have amassed over the years. As you can imagine the majority of the films appear towards the latter end of the 3D space. However, if you slide back
                    far enough you'll see that there are a couple of films from the 1970's that can match the revenue of more modern films (see below).
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/instruct2.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>
                    So, even in a very small dataset such as this, you can see that displaying the data in three dimensions allows any time-varying patterns or discrepancies
                    to be observed.
                </p>
                <h3>Customisation</h3>
                <p>
                    Almost all the aspects of the visualisation can be customised. If you click on the Appearance section of the GUI on the right-hand side then you'll see a whole range
                    of options that can be configured. For instance the font height and width can be made bigger so that the text may be easier to see (just move the sliders to
                    experiment). All the various colours within the visualisation can be changed, so click on the Background colour picker and move the circle around and the colour of
                    the background will update in real time (see image below).
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/instruct3.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>
                    You can also alter the way that certain aspects of the data is displayed. For example if you select the LabelBottom drop down menu (at the bottom) you can alter
                    what gets displayed against each node in the 3D space. Selecting Year for example will show the year that the film was released below the data in the visualisation.
                </p>
