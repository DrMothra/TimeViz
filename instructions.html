Welcome to the TimeViz visualisation application. This app gives a demonstration of a more general visualisation tool being developed to visualise multi-dimensional or time-varying data.
When the page first loads you'll see a number of data items. They may not look too clear but we can soon rectify this with the extensive range of customisation options.

You can use the mouse buttons to move around the scene - the left mouse rotates, the middle mouse button pans around the scene and the mouse wheel enables zooming in and out of the scene.
If you now zoom in you'll see the data items a little more closely as illustrated below:-

If you then look at the GUI on the right hand side and click on Appearance then a list of options appears:-

If you now increase the fontWidth to something like 20 and the fontHeight to something like 10 then the labels should now become much clearer. We'll examine the other options later.

If you close the Appearance option, we'll now examine the data analysis options.

If you click on the Data option then the following items will be displayed:-

If you zoom out and then experiment with the year slider you will see all the films that correspond to the years in question, note the information being updated in the info bar on the left hand
side.

If you use the left mouse button to rotate around the scene then you can see the range of years being considered. Experiment with the Selection slide to narrow or widen the range of years in the
view.
