                    Welcome to the TimeViz visualisation application. This app gives a demonstration of a more general visualisation tool being developed to visualise multi-dimensional
                    or time-varying data. In this example we have used information relating to the highest grossing horror films of all time and cross-referenced this with their
                    individual ratings as given by film review websites. This illustrates how attributes of the data can be viewed over a period of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the page first loads you'll see a number of data items. You can use the mouse buttons to move around the scene and get a different view of the data
                    - the left mouse rotates, the middle mouse button
                    pans around the mouse wheel enables zooming in and out of the scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To gain an insight as to how the data varies over time, adjust the view such that you are can see the transparent area that the data is contained within
                    (you may have to zoom out a little). This represents
                    both the year that the data is applicable to and the time range under consideration. If you now look at the GUI at the top right then you'll see a label marked
                    Data. if you click on this then you'll see a couple of sliders that enable you to select the individual year and an appropriate time range. The number of films within
                    the selected region is displayed in the information panel on the left-hand side (along with all the year data). If you now slide the year slider around you'll see how
                    much money the films have amassed over the years. As you can imagine the majority of the films appear towards the latter end of the 3D space. However, if you slide back
                    far enough you'll see that there are a couple of films from the 1970's that can match the revenue of more modern films.
